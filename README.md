Here's the box model page I was demoing with from Lesson 3. 

I commented in the files more detailed explanations on how things work. 

To clone this repo in your computer, do the following: 

1. Open terminal 

2. cd into the directory you want the file to be in (Desktop, Documents, a folder you made for the class)

3. Type 'git clone git@github.com:samfrons/WD100-Lesson3.git' into terminal (but without the quotes)

4. Then a folder called 'WD100-Lesson3' will appear!
